SOW.00.sec=Each {_PO} and/or {_SOW} issued pursuant to {_this_Agreement} shall be deemed incorporated into and governed by the terms of this {_MSA}, and the {_Supplier}'s provision of {_Services} shall be governed by this {_MSA} as supplemented by the terms of the applicable {_PO} and/or {_SOW}. Where the terms of a {_PO} or {_SOW} conflict with the terms of the {_MSA}, which existed prior to such {_PO} or {_SOW}, the terms of the pre-existing {_MSA} shall prevail, except to the extent that the {_PO} or {_SOW} expressly states that the {_MSA} is to be overridden or modified.

Change.Ti=Changes to a {_PO} or {_SOW}

Change.sec={_Company} may at any time, in writing, make reasonable changes in the work described in a {_PO} or {_SOW}.

Any {_Supplier} claim for an adjustment must be asserted {ClaimForAdjustment.days} of {_Supplier}'s receipt of the change notification, and must be approved in a written amendment ("{_Change_Order}").

Affiliate.2.sec=shall be deemed a separate contract between the parties who sign it; and

Affiliate.3.sec=is an independent contractual obligation from any other {_PO} or {_SOW}.

Affiliate.00.sec=The term "{_Company}" as used in {_this_Agreement} shall, for the purposes of any {_PO} or {_SOW}, issued by a {_Company_Affiliate} hereunder, be deemed to include only the {_Company_Affiliate} issuing such {_PO} or {_SOW}.
