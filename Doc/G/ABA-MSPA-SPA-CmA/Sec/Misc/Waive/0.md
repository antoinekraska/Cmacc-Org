Ti=No Waiver

1.sec=Neither any failure nor any delay by any {_party} in exercising any right, power{q} or privilege under {_this_Agreement} or any of the documents referred to in {_this_Agreement} will operate as a waiver of such right, power{q} or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power{q} or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power{q} or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power{q} or privilege.

2.0.sec=To the maximum extent permitted by applicable {_Legal_Requirements}:

2.1.sec=no claim or right arising out of {_this_Agreement} or any of the documents referred to in {_this_Agreement} can be waived by a {_party}, in whole or in part, unless made in a writing signed by {WritingSignedBy.cl};

Note=Alternatives, with the most common as the default.  The MSPA uses PartyOrSeller.  We fix that in the MSPA/Misc.

WritingSignedBy.Party.cl=such {_party}

WritingSignedBy.PartyOrSeller.cl=such {_party} or {_Sellers'_Representative} on behalf of a {_Seller}

WritingSignedBy.cl={WritingSignedBy.Party.cl}

2.3.0.sec=no notice to or demand on a {_party} will:

2.3.1.sec=waive or otherwise affect any obligation of that {_party}; or

2.3.2.sec=affect the right of the {_party} giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in {_this_Agreement} or the documents referred to in {_this_Agreement}.
