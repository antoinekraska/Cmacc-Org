Ti=Notices

0.sec=All notices and other communications required or permitted by {_this_Agreement} shall be in writing and will be effective, and any applicable time period shall commence, when 

1.sec=(a) delivered to the following address by hand or by a nationally recognized overnight courier service (costs prepaid) addressed to the following address or 

2.sec=(b) transmitted electronically to the following facsimile numbers or e-mail addresses, 

00.sec=in each case marked to the attention of the {_Person} (by name or title) designated below (or to such other address, facsimile number, e-mail address, or {_Person} as a party may designate by notice to the other parties):<ul type="none"><li>{Seller.Representative.Notice.Block}<br><br><li>{Buyer.Notice.Block}</ul>

=[G/Z/para/s2]
  

Note=The structure of the sentence tail, "in each case ..." is explicit in referring to both (a) and (b).  The 0, 1, 2, 00 structure reinforces this.  Which raises, of course, the question of the extent to which the structure of the source will be understood to contribute to the meaning of the document.  Bearing perhaps some similarity to legislative history or "reporter's comments."
