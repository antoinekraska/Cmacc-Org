Ti=Setoff Right

sec=Upon notice to {_Sellers'_Representative} specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, {_Buyer} may set off any amount to which it claims to be entitled from any {_Seller}, including any amounts that may be owed under this {Claim.Xref} or otherwise, against amounts otherwise payable under the {_Promissory_Notes} or any provision of {_this_Agreement}.  The exercise of such right of setoff by {_Buyer} in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute a default under {_this_Agreement}, the {_Promissory_Notes}, or any instrument securing any of the {_Promissory_Notes}, regardless of whether any {_Seller} disputes such setoff claim, or whether such setoff claim is for a contingent or an unliquidated amount.  Neither the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of setoff or give notice of a claim under the {_Escrow_Agreement} will constitute an election of remedies or limit {_Buyer} in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.
