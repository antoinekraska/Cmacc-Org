If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is less than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Sellers} to {_Buyer}.  If the {_Closing_Date_Shareholders'_Equity} is greater than the {_Interim_Shareholders'_Equity}, subject to {Claim.Setoff.Xref}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Buyer} to {_Sellers}.

If the {_Adjustment_Amount} is to be paid by {_Sellers} to {_Buyer}, the {_Adjustment_Amount} shall be paid by {_Sellers} by wire transfer to {_Buyer} pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided by {_Buyer} to {_Sellers'_Representative} prior to the due date for the payment set forth in {Sale.AdjustPrice.Interest.Xref}.

Interest.sec=All payments under this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref} shall be made together with interest at the rate set forth in the {_Promissory_Notes}, which interest will begin accruing on the {_Closing_Date} and end on the day before the payment is made.  Within three (3) {_Business_Days} after the {_Closing_Balance_Sheet} and {_Adjustment_Amount} become binding on the parties pursuant to {Sale.AdjustProcedure.Xref}, {_Sellers} or {_Buyer}, as the case may be, shall make the payment provided for in this {Sale.AdjustPrice.Xref}.
