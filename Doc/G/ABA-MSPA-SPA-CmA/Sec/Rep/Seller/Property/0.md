All {_Leased_Real_Property} is leased pursuant to valid written leases listed in {DL.Rep.Seller.Contract(a).Xref}.  Such leases contain the entire agreement between the landlord of each of the leased premises and the {_Acquired_Company}, and there is no other {_Contract} between the landlord and any {_Acquired_Company} affecting such {_Leased_Real_Property}.  No {_Acquired_Company} leases {_Real_Property} as a lessor or sub-lessor.

All buildings, plants, and structures owned by any {_Acquired_Company} lie wholly within the boundaries of the {_Real_Property} in question and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights of, any other {_Person}.  There are no buildings, structures, fixtures, or other improvements primarily situated on adjoining property that encroach on any part of the {_Real_Property}.  Each parcel of {_Real_Property} abuts on, and has direct vehicular access to, a public road or has access to a public road via a permanent, irrevocable, appurtenant easement benefiting such {_Real_Property} and constituting a part thereof.  Certificates of occupancy are in full force and effect for each location of {_Real_Property}, and the uses thereof being made by the {_Acquired_Companies} do not violate any applicable zoning, subdivision, land use, or other {_Legal_Requirement}.  No {_Third_Party} has a right to acquire any interest in the {_Owned_Real_Property} or in the {_Acquired_Companies}' interests in the {_Leased_Real_Property}.  There is no existing or proposed plan to modify or realign any street or highway or any existing or proposed eminent domain {_Proceeding} that would result in the taking of all or any part of any parcel of {_Real_Property} or that would prevent or hinder the continued use of any such parcel as used by the {_Acquired_Companies}.  None of the {_Real_Property} is located within a flood plain for flood insurance purposes.
