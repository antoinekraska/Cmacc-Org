Except as set forth in {DL.Rep.Seller.EmployeeBenefits(c).Xref}, each {_Employee_Plan} that provides health or welfare benefits is fully insured, and any incurred but not reported claims under each such {_Employee_Plan} that is not fully insured have been properly accrued.  Each {_Acquired_Company} has paid in full all required insurance premiums, subject only to normal retrospective adjustments in the {_Ordinary_Course_of_Business}, with regard to each {_Employee_Plan}.

5.sec=The form of each {_Employee_Plan} is in compliance with the applicable terms of {_ERISA}, the {_Code}, and any other applicable {_Legal_Requirement}, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and each {_Employee_Plan} has been operated in compliance with such {_Legal_Requirements} and the written {_Employee_Plan} documents.  No {_Acquired_Company} and no fiduciary of an {_Employee_Plan} has violated the requirements of Section 404 of {_ERISA}.  Each required report and description of an {_Employee_Plan} (including {_IRS} Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions, and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (to the extent required) timely filed with the {_IRS}, the United States Department of Labor, or other {_Governmental_Body} and distributed as required, and all notices required by {_ERISA} or the {_Code} or any other {_Legal_Requirement} with respect to each {_Employee_Plan} have been appropriately given.

To the {_Knowledge_of_Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter.  Each trust created under any such {_Employee_Plan} has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the {_Code}, and, to the {_Knowledge_of_Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in a revocation of such exemption.  No {_Employee_Plan} is intended to meet the requirements of {_Code} Section 501(c)(9).  No circumstance exists that could give rise to a loss of any intended tax consequence or to any Tax under Section 511 of the {_Code} with respect to any {_Employee_Plan}.

Neither the execution and delivery of {_this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {_Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in the assessment of a Tax or penalty under Section 4975 of the {_Code} or Section 502(l) of {_ERISA} or result in a violation of Section 406 of {_ERISA}.

8.sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {_this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {_Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), obligate any {_Acquired_Company} to pay any separation, severance, termination, or similar benefit to, or accelerate the time of vesting for, change the time of payment to, or increase the amount of compensation due to, any director, employee, officer, former employee, or former officer of any {_Acquired_Company}.

10.sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {_this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {_Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in an amendment, modification, or termination of any {_Employee_Plan}.

12.sec=No {_Acquired_Company} contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of {_ERISA} or Section 414(f) of the {_Code} or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the {_Code}.

13.sec=Except as set forth in {DL.Rep.Seller.EmployeeBenefits(m).Xref}, no {_Employee_Plan} is subject to Section 409A of the {_Code}.  Each {_Employee_Plan} subject to Section 409A of the {_Code} ("Deferred Compensation Plan") complies in all material respects with Section 409A of the {_Code}.  No {_Acquired_Company} has (i) granted to any {_Person} an interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan that is, or upon the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest will be, subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the {_Code}, or (ii) materially modified any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could cause an interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4) of the {_Code}.
