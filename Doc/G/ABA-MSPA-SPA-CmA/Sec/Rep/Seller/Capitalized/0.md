No {_Acquired_Company} has any outstanding subscription, option, warrant, call or exchange right, convertible security, or other {_Contract} or other obligations in effect giving any {_Person} (other than another {_Acquired_Company}) the right to acquire (whether by preemptive rights or otherwise) any {_Equity_Security} of any {_Acquired_Company}.
