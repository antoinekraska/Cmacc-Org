Ti=Effect of Termination

0.sec=Each party's right of termination under {Life.Terminate.Event.Xref} is in addition to any other right it may have under {_this_Agreement} (including under {Misc.Injunction.Xref}) or otherwise, and the exercise of a party's right of termination will not constitute an election of remedies.  If {_this_Agreement} is terminated pursuant to {Life.Terminate.Event.Xref}, {_this_Agreement} will be of no further force or effect; provided, however, that

1.sec=this {Life.Terminate.Effect.Xref} and {Misc.Xref} will survive the termination of {_this_Agreement} and will remain in full force and effect, and

2.sec=the termination of {_this_Agreement} will not relieve any party from any liability for any {_Breach} of {_this_Agreement} occurring prior to termination.
