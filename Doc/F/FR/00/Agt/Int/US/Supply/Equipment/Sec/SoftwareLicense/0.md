7.Ti={_Third_Party_Products}

7.sec={_Manufacturer} resells licenses from certain third party software or services as identified on the applicable {_Price_List} (“{_Third_Party_Products}”), which products are subject to separate agreements or terms with the applicable third party suppliers (“{_Third_Party_Product_Terms}”) unless other terms are expressly set forth in applicable {_Third_Party_Product_Terms} for a specific {_Third_Party_Product}.  {_Third_Party_Product_Terms} are available for review on at {Manufacturer.com/legal/thirdpartyterms.URL}  (or other URL designated by {_Manufacturer}) or, if applicable, are negotiated and executed by and between the applicable third party supplier and {_Customer}.  If {_Customer} purchases any {_Third_Party_Products}, {_Customer} acknowledges and agrees that it is bound by the applicable {_Third_Party_Product_Terms}.  For purchases of {_Third_Party_Products} directly from {_Manufacturer}, the payment-related terms applicable to the {_Software} shall apply equally to the {_Third_Party_Products}.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this {SoftwareLicense.Xref}.6, this {_Agreement} shall not apply to the {_Third_Party_Products} and {_Customer} acknowledges and agrees that The {_Manufacturer} disclaims all warranties, indemnities, obligations, and other liabilities in connection with any {_Third_Party_Product}.  If support and maintenance is offered for a specific {_Third_Party_Product} and {_Customer} purchases directly from {_Manufacturer}, {_Manufacturer}’s sole and exclusive obligation is to distribute any applicable {_Third_Party_Product} error correction, update, upgrade and other release provided to {_Manufacturer} for customers purchasing support and maintenance and/or to provide any first-line technical support as described in {_Manufacturer}’s published documentation for such support and maintenance offering.  In no event shall manufacturer’s liability arising out of or in connection with any third party product, however caused and under any theory of liability, whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise, (i) exceed the amounts received by manufacturer for the applicable third party product and (ii) with respect to the support and maintenance services related thereto (if any), exceed any amounts received by manufacturer for the applicable support and maintenance services in the then-current term.
   
8.Ti=Third Party Suppliers

8.sec=The {_Software} may contain or be provided with third party proprietary program, interfaces, firmware and other software licensed by {_Manufacturer} (“{_Third_Party_Components}”) or third party services that are made available through the {_Software} (“{_Third_Party_Services}”).  In connection therewith, additional or different terms may be applicable as identified on {Manufacturer.com/legal/thirdpartyterms.URL} (or other URL designated by {_Manufacturer}) or otherwise made available to {_Customer} (which terms are hereby incorporated by reference herein).  {_Customer} agrees to, and its usage and/or access of {_Third_Party_Components} and {_Third_Party_Services} is subject to, such terms.  Any {_Third_Party_Services} are made available to {_Customer} subject to {_Customer} having currently purchased {_Support_and_Maintenance_Services} either from {_Manufacturer} directly or an {_Authorized_Reseller}; no additional fees shall be due or charged in connection with the provision of such {_Third_Party_Services}.
