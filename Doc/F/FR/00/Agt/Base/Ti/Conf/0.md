There are four sections for defining the scope of in vs out.  The "Define.Confidential_Information", and the notions of Include, Exclude and Except. Exclude are (perhaps unusually) distinguished.  Exclude is for kinds of information that are not included, e.g., never confidential.  Except assumes that the kind of info qualifies for confidentiality, but that there is some reason to not include it.  E.g., WasPublic; BecomesPublic; Had; Finds; Makes.

Except.LI can have two formats of exceptions.  There is the general section, which has an intro (0.sec) and list of short statements (*.sec).  There are also full sections, with titles and a complete text.  These can be used for more complex or complete descriptions, such as Except.Compelled.Sec.
