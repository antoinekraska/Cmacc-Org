Ti={_Project_Change_Procedure}

1.sec=The {_Project_Change_Procedure} is a crucial mechanism that can affect the success or failure of this {_Project}. This process is the primary vehicle for containing scope and giving management the opportunity to make timely trade-offs between the three key project variables of cost, time, and scope. It is important that potential changes are identified early, documented carefully, and resolved at the appropriate levels of responsibility.

2.0.sec={_Project_Change}s are broadly defined as work activities or work products not originally planned for as defined by this {_SOW}. More specifically, changes will include the following:

2.1.sec=Any scope items not listed in this {_SOW} ({Scope.Xref}),

2.2.sec=Participation in activities not previously included in this {_SOW}â€™s list of work activities ({Approach.Xref}.2),

2.3.sec=Provision or development of deliverables not included in this {_SOW} ({Approach.Xref}.3),

2.4.sec=A change in responsibilities, as defined in this {_SOW} ({Approach.Xref}, {Manage.Xref}, or {Assume.Xref}) between {_Vendor} and {_Client}, including reallocation of project staffing,

2.5.sec=Any rework of completed activities or accepted deliverables,

2.6.sec=Investigative work to determine the impact of major changes,

2.7.sec=Assumptions not remaining valid,

2.8.sec=Risks that actually occurred,

2.9.sec=Delays caused by schedule slippage, and

2.10.sec=Variances of actual work effort from estimated effort.

3.sec=In order to manage change properly, a {_Project_Change_Procedure} will be established to identify, record, assess, and approve changes to this {_Project}. {_Vendor} and {_Client} will follow this process to classify, prioritize, approve, or reject changes. {_Project_Change_Request}s need to be clearly defined, including cost and schedule implications, to allow {_Vendor} and {_Client} management to make appropriate decisions. {_Vendor} will always need prior authorization and approval of expenditures by {_Client} before starting work on changes.

4.sec=This information will be identified and tracked as part of the monitoring and reporting processes defined in {Manage.Xref}.1.2 and {Manage.Xref}.1.3.

5.sec=At the beginning of this {_Project} {_Vendor} and {_Client} management will institute a mutually acceptable change control procedure.
