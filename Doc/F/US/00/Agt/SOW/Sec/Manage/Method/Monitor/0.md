Ti=Process to Monitor Progress

1.sec=The detailed project plan is the key vehicle for measuring progress. The specific activities that each team member works on, and their progress against completing those activities, are the only objective measure of where this {_Project} stands against the schedule and budget. To capture this information every team member, both {_Vendor} and {_Client}, will record and report their actual hours spent on {_Project} activities against the budgeted time in the project plan. In addition, each team member will provide estimates of the effort remaining on activities that have not been completed.

2.sec=This information will be recorded on a weekly time sheet and given to the appropriate manager along with a status report that provides a brief description of work accomplished, issues/problems, and planned work. The management team will determine where this {_Project} stands versus the schedule and budget by analysis of this information.
