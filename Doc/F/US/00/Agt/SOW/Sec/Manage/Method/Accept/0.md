0.sec=All of the completed deliverables identified in this SOW will be formally submitted for final review and approval.

2.sec=The deliverables will include an acceptance form for signature;

3.sec=Each deliverable will have clearly documented, objective acceptance criteria;

4.sec=There will be a specified time-frame for acceptance/rejection of each deliverable; and

5.sec=Deliverables will be deemed accepted if the acceptance time-frame is exceeded.

00.sec=In order to avoid delays in the schedule and the associated increased cost due to slow deliverable review, deliverables not reviewed and approved within a review period of NN work days will be considered accepted. Feedback supplied after the review period will be evaluated as a change of scope.
