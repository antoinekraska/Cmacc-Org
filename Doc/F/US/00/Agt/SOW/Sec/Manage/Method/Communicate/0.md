Ti=Means of Communication 

1.sec=Because {_Vendor} and {_Client} are responsible for managing this {_Project}, it is important that we use a formal process to support timely and accurate communication between the organizations. There are two key vehicles for providing this communication: a weekly status report and a weekly status meeting.

2.0.sec=As mentioned earlier, all team members will report progress and status weekly. This information, and the analysis of it, will be summarized into a project status report for {_Client} and {_Vendor} Management. This report contains the following information:

2.1.sec=Significant Problems/Actions Taken,

2.2.sec=Progress Summary,

2.3.sec=Accomplishments,

2.4.sec=Planned Accomplishments,

2.5.sec=Budget Status, and

2.6.sec=Issues Log (discussed later).

3.0.sec=The weekly project status meeting will be used to review this {_Project} status and open issues in the status report. The {_Vendor} and {_Client} management team must be committed to having this meeting and making it effective. The keys to making the meeting worthwhile are the following:

3.1.sec=Have the meetings often enough so that timely information is available;

3.2.sec=Focus the meeting on major issues or areas where management action or intervention is required; and 

3.3.sec=Make sure that the information provided is accurate and objective.
