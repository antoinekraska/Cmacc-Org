Ti=Approach for Dealing with Issues

0.sec=Every project has issues that hinder progress. It is important that these issues are identified and resolved quickly by the right person. The first step in effectively dealing with these issues is to make the entire team aware of the importance of identifying issues and getting proper resolution. We will then use the following procedure to track the identified issues:

1.Ti=Identify issues

1.sec=When this {_Project} begins, we will start identifying any issues that could hinder our ability to meet the objectives of this {_Project}. Issues can be identified by anyone involved with this {_Project}.

2.Ti=Document the issue

2.sec=The person who identifies the issue must document it.

3.Ti=Assign responsibility for resolving issues

3.sec=The {_Vendor}/{_Client} management team will determine the appropriate individual who will be responsible for resolving each issue. The responsible person must be an individual who has the knowledge and authority to make decisions regarding the issue. The management team will also assign a priority to the issue.

4.Ti=Monitor and control progress

4.sec=All issues will be tracked on an issues log that will be maintained to formally track the status and resolution of the issues.

5.Ti=Report progress on issue resolution

5.sec=As mentioned earlier, the issues log will be a part of the weekly status report and discussed in the weekly status meeting.

6.Ti=Communicate issue resolution

6.sec=The issues log and documented resolutions of issues will be made available to all team members.

00.sec=In the event that an issue cannot be resolved in a reasonable time-frame, to the mutual satisfaction of {_Vendor} and {_Client}, we will determine a mutually acceptable approach to escalating it to the next level of management.
