Ti=Agreed-Upon Baseline

1.sec=This {_SOW} is the foundation or baseline for all the key project management activities on this {_Project}. It identifies the work activities that will be tracked, defines the boundaries for scope control, identifies responsibilities, and clarifies many of the areas where issues may arise that need to be managed.

2.sec=The {_SOW} is then used as the basis for creating a detailed project plan for all the work activities to be performed on this {_Project}. Every activity will have an estimate of work effort. All {_Project} team members, from {_Vendor} and {_Client}, will be assigned these activities, and this will determine the cost of the activity based on the cost of the individual team members assigned to it.

3.sec=Once all the activities are allocated to team members, this {_Project} plan is leveled and loaded against the calendar. This completed plan represents the baseline plan. This plan will provide the key milestone dates to track schedule progress.

4.sec=The summation of all activity costs from the baselined {_Project} plan, plus expenses, plus the costs of purchased items like hardware, software, and other services, will represent the budget that the {_Vendor}/{_Client} management team will track against.
