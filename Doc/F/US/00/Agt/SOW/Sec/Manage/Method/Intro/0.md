0.sec={_Vendor} and {_Client} are jointly responsible for the management of the project and for providing the necessary resources to the project. Our joint management objectives are focused on tightly monitoring, controlling, and balancing the projectâ€™s three key constraints: Scope (or Product), Budget, and Schedule. To be effective in achieving this primary management objective, we must establish:

1.sec=An agreed-upon baseline,

2.sec=A process to monitor progress,

3.sec=A clear means of communication,

4.sec=An open approach for dealing with issues,

5.sec=An objective change control procedure,

6.sec=A process to recognize and manage risks,

7.sec=An approach for accepting project deliverables, and

8.sec=A definition of what constitutes project completion.

00.sec=This section describes the basic approaches that we will use to provide this type of control.
