Alt1.Ti=[Use the following paragraph if the Term Sheet calls for no specific dividend on the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, but an equal sharing if dividends are declared on the {_Common_Stock}.]

Alt1.sec=The {_Corporation} shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the {_Corporation} (other than dividends on shares of {_Common_Stock} payable in shares of {_Common_Stock}) unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents required elsewhere in the Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} in an amount at least equal to (i) in the case of a dividend on {_Common_Stock} or any class or series that is convertible into {_Common_Stock}, that dividend per share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} as would equal the product of (A) the dividend payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all shares of such class or series had been converted into {_Common_Stock} and (B) the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon conversion of a share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, in each case calculated on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (ii) in the case of a dividend on any class or series that is not convertible into {_Common_Stock}, at a rate per share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} determined by (A) dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital stock by the original issuance price of such class or series of capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series) and (B) multiplying such fraction by an amount equal to the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Price} (as defined below); provided that, if the {_Corporation} declares, pays or sets aside, on the same date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the {_Corporation}, the dividend payable to the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} pursuant to this Section 1 shall be calculated based upon the dividend on the class or series of capital stock that would result in the highest {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} dividend.  The “{_Series_A_Original_Issue_Price}” shall mean $[insert initial Series A purchase price] per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}.

Alt2.Ti=[Use the following paragraph if the Term Sheet calls for a specified cumulative dividend, payable if and when declared by the Board.]

The {_Corporation} shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the {_Corporation} (other than dividends on shares of {_Common_Stock} payable in shares of {_Common_Stock}) unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents required elsewhere in the Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} in an amount at least equal to [the greater of][the sum of] (i) the amount of the aggregate {_Accruing_Dividend}s then accrued on such share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} and not previously paid and (ii) (A) in the case of a dividend on {_Common_Stock} or any class or series that is convertible into {_Common_Stock}, that dividend per share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} as would equal the product of (1) the dividend payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all shares of such class or series had been converted into {_Common_Stock} and (2) the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon conversion of a share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, in each case calculated on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (B) in the case of a dividend on any class or series that is not convertible into {_Common_Stock}, at a rate per share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} determined by (1) dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital stock by the original issuance price of such class or series of capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series) and (2) multiplying such fraction by an amount equal to the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Price} (as defined below); provided that if the {_Corporation} declares, pays or sets aside, on the same date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the {_Corporation}, the dividend payable to the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} pursuant to this Section 1 shall be calculated based upon the dividend on the class or series of capital stock that would result in the highest {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} dividend.
