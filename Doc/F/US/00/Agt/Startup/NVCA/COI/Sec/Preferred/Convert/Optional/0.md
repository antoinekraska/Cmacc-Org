Ti=Optional Conversion
  
0.sec=The holders of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall have conversion rights as follows (the "{_Conversion_Right}s"):

1.Ti=Right to Convert

1.1.Ti=Conversion Ratio

1.1.sec=Each share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of {_Common_Stock} as is determined by dividing the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Price} by the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.  The "{_Series_A_Conversion_Price}" shall initially be equal to $_______ [insert original purchase price of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}].  Such initial {_Series_A_Conversion_Price}, and the rate at which shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} may be converted into shares of {_Common_Stock}, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.

1.2.Ti=Termination of {_Conversion_Right}s

1.2.sec=In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} pursuant to Section 6, the {_Conversion_Right}s of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which case the {_Conversion_Right}s for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full.  In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the {_Corporation} or a {_Deemed_Liquidation_Event}, the {_Conversion_Right}s shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}.

1.=[Z/ol/2]

2.Ti=Fractional Shares

2.sec=No fractional shares of {_Common_Stock} shall be issued upon conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the {_Corporation} shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of {_Common_Stock} as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the {_Corporation}.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} the holder is at the time converting into {_Common_Stock} and the aggregate number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon such conversion.

3.Ti=Mechanics of Conversion

3.1.Ti=Notice of Conversion

3.1.sec=In order for a holder of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} to voluntarily convert shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} into shares of {_Common_Stock}, such holder shall (a) provide written notice to the {_Corporation}'s transfer agent at the office of the transfer agent for the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} (or at the principal office of the {_Corporation} if the {_Corporation} serves as its own transfer agent) that such holder elects to convert all or any number of such holder's shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent and (b), if such holder's shares are certificated, surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the {_Corporation} to indemnify the {_Corporation} against any claim that may be made against the {_Corporation} on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} (or at the principal office of the {_Corporation} if the {_Corporation} serves as its own transfer agent).  Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the shares of {_Common_Stock} to be issued.  If required by the {_Corporation}, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the {_Corporation}, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the {_Corporation} if the {_Corporation} serves as its own transfer agent) of such notice and, if applicable, certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) shall be the time of conversion (the "{_Conversion_Time}"), and the shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon conversion of the specified shares shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date.  The {_Corporation} shall, as soon as practicable after the {_Conversion_Time} (i) [issue and deliver to such holder of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into {_Common_Stock}], (ii) pay in cash such amount as provided in Subsection 4.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of {_Common_Stock} otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} converted.

3.2.Ti=Reservation of Shares

3.2.sec=The {_Corporation} shall at all times when the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, such number of its duly authorized shares of {_Common_Stock} as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of {_Common_Stock} shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, the {_Corporation} shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of {_Common_Stock} to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.  Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} below the then par value of the shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, the {_Corporation} will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the {_Corporation} may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of {_Common_Stock} at such adjusted {_Series_A_Conversion_Price}.

3.3.Ti=Effect of Conversion

3.3.sec=All shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the {_Conversion_Time}, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of {_Common_Stock} in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Subsection 4.2 and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the {_Corporation} may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} accordingly. 

3.4.Ti=No Further Adjustment

3.4.sec=Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} surrendered for conversion or on the {_Common_Stock} delivered upon conversion.

3.5.Ti=Taxes

3.5.sec=The {_Corporation} shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of {_Common_Stock} upon conversion of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} pursuant to this Section 4.  The {_Corporation} shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of {_Common_Stock} in a name other than that in which the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the {_Corporation} the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the {_Corporation}, that such tax has been paid.

4.=[F/US/00/Agt/Startup/NVCA/COI/Sec/Preferred/Convert/Optional/Adjust/Dilute/0.md]

5.Ti=Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations

5.sec=If the {_Corporation} shall at any time or from time to time after the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Date} effect a subdivision of the outstanding {_Common_Stock}, the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of {_Common_Stock} outstanding.  If the {_Corporation} shall at any time or from time to time after the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Date} combine the outstanding shares of {_Common_Stock}, the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of {_Common_Stock} outstanding.  Any adjustment under this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

6.Ti=Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions

6.0.sec=In the event the {_Corporation} at any time or from time to time after the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Date} shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of {_Common_Stock} entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the {_Common_Stock} in additional shares of {_Common_Stock}, then and in each such event the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} then in effect by a fraction:

6.1.sec=the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

6.2.sec=the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of {_Common_Stock} in a number equal to the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} as they would have received if all outstanding shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} had been converted into {_Common_Stock} on the date of such event.

6.=[Z/ol/s2]

7.Ti=Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions

7.sec=In the event the {_Corporation} at any time or from time to time after the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Date} shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of {_Common_Stock} entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the {_Corporation} (other than a distribution of shares of {_Common_Stock} in respect of outstanding shares of {_Common_Stock}) or in other property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each such event the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of {_Common_Stock}, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} had been converted into {_Common_Stock} on the date of such event.

8.Ti=Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc.

8.sec=Subject to the provisions of Subsection 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the {_Corporation} in which the {_Common_Stock} (but not the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Subsections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the {_Common_Stock} into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} of the {_Corporation} issuable upon conversion of one share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the {_Corporation}) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price}) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}.  [For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Subsection 4.8 shall be construed as preventing the holders of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} from seeking any appraisal rights to which they are otherwise entitled under the DGCL in connection with a merger triggering an adjustment hereunder, nor shall this Subsection 4.8 be deemed conclusive evidence of the fair value of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} in any such appraisal proceeding.]

9.Ti=Certificate as to Adjustments

9.sec=Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} pursuant to this Section 4, the {_Corporation} at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than [ten (10)] days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  The {_Corporation} shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} (but in any event not later than [ten (10)] days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} then in effect, and (ii) the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}.

10.Ti=Notice of Record Date

10.0.sec=In the event:

10.1.sec=the {_Corporation} shall take a record of the holders of its {_Common_Stock} (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

10.2.sec=of any capital reorganization of the {_Corporation}, any reclassification of the {_Common_Stock} of the {_Corporation}, or any {_Deemed_Liquidation_Event}; or

10.3.sec=of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the {_Corporation}, then, and in each such case, the {_Corporation} will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of {_Common_Stock} (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of {_Common_Stock} (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to the {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} and the {_Common_Stock}.  Such notice shall be sent at least [ten (10)] days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.
