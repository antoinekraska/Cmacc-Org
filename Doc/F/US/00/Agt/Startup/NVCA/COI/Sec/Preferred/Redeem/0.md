Ti=Redemption

1.Ti=General

1.sec=Unless prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders, shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall be redeemed by the {_Corporation} at a price equal to [the greater of (A)][the {_Series_A_Original_Issue_Price} per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon][and (B) the Fair Market Value (determined in the manner set forth below) of a single share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} as of the date of the {_Corporation}’s receipt of the {_Redemption_Request}] (the “{_Redemption_Price}”), in three (3) annual installments commencing not more than sixty (60) days after receipt by the {_Corporation} at any time on or after [_____________], from the holders of at least [specify percentage] of the then outstanding shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} (the “{_Redemption_Request}”). Upon receipt of a {_Redemption_Request}, the {_Corporation} shall apply all of its assets to any such redemption, and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders.  [For purposes of this Subsection 6.1, the Fair Market Value of a single share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall be the value of a single share of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} as mutually agreed upon by the {_Corporation} and the holders of a majority of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} then outstanding, and, in the event that they are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party appraiser agreed to by the {_Corporation} and the holders of a majority of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} then outstanding.]  The date of each such installment shall be referred to as a “{_Redemption_Date}.”  On each {_Redemption_Date}, the {_Corporation} shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} outstanding immediately prior to such {_Redemption_Date} by (ii) the number of remaining {_Redemption_Date}s (including the {_Redemption_Date} to which such calculation applies)[; provided, however, that {_Excluded_Share}s (as such term is defined in Subsection 6.2) shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in this sentence].  If on any {_Redemption_Date} Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the {_Corporation} from redeeming all shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} to be redeemed, the {_Corporation} shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.

2.Ti={_Redemption_Notice}

2.0.sec=The {_Corporation} shall send written notice of the mandatory redemption (the “{_Redemption_Notice}”) to each holder of record of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} not less than forty (40) days prior to each {_Redemption_Date}.  Each {_Redemption_Notice} shall state:

2.1.sec=(a)	the number of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} held by the holder that the {_Corporation} shall redeem on the {_Redemption_Date} specified in the {_Redemption_Notice};

2.2.sec=(b)	the {_Redemption_Date} and the {_Redemption_Price};

2.3.sec=(c)	the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such shares terminates (as determined in accordance with Subsection 4.1); and

2.4.sec=(d)	for holders of shares in certificated form, that the holder is to surrender to the {_Corporation}, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} to be redeemed.

2.00.sec=[If the {_Corporation} receives, on or prior to the twentieth (20th) day after the date of delivery of the {_Redemption_Notice} to a holder of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock}, written notice from such holder that such holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this Section 6, then the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} registered on the books of the {_Corporation} in the name of such holder at the time of the {_Corporation}’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “{_Excluded_Share}s.”  {_Excluded_Share}s shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such {_Redemption_Date} or thereafter.]

3.Ti=Surrender of Certificates; Payment

3.sec=On or before the applicable {_Redemption_Date}, each holder of shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} to be redeemed on such {_Redemption_Date}, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4, shall, if a holder of shares in certificated form, surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the {_Corporation} to indemnify the {_Corporation} against any claim that may be made against the {_Corporation} on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the {_Corporation}, in the manner and at the place designated in the {_Redemption_Notice}, and thereupon the {_Redemption_Price} for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof.  In the event less than all of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate, instrument, or book entry representing the unredeemed shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall promptly be issued to such holder.

4.Ti=Rights Subsequent to Redemption

4.sec=If the {_Redemption_Notice} shall have been duly given, and if on the applicable {_Redemption_Date} the {_Redemption_Price} payable upon redemption of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} to be redeemed on such {_Redemption_Date} is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any of the shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of {_Series_A_Preferred_Stock} shall cease to accrue after such {_Redemption_Date} and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the {_Redemption_Date} terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the {_Redemption_Price} without interest upon surrender of any such  certificate or certificates therefor.
