3.5.sec=If the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any {_Option} or Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the {_Corporation} upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such {_Option} or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} provided for in this Subsection 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this Subsection 4.4.3).  If the number of shares of {_Common_Stock} issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any {_Option} or Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the {_Corporation} upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such {_Option} or Convertible Security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} that would result under the terms of this Subsection 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the {_Series_A_Conversion_Price} that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made.
