6.Ti=Warranty and Disclaimer

6.sec={_Company} shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the {_Services} in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions in the {_Services} and shall perform the {_Implementation_Services} in a professional and workmanlike manner.  {_Services} may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by {_Company} or by third-party providers, or because of other causes beyond {_Company}'s reasonable control, but {_Company} shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled service disruption. <span style="text-transform:uppercase"> However, {_Company} does not warrant that the {_Services} will be uninterrupted or error free; nor does it make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from use of the {_Services}.  Except as expressly set forth in this Section, the {_Services} and {_Implementation_Services} are provided "as is" and {_Company} disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</span>


7.Ti=Indemnity

Note=OPTIONAL: many start-up companies choose not to offer indemnity as a starting point - particularly for very low cost services. Otherwise, the formulation below is a fairly {_Company}-favorable indemnity provision.

7.sec={_Company} shall hold {_Customer} harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the {_Service} of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided {_Company} is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; {_Company} will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.  The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the {_Service} (i) not supplied by {_Company}, (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance with {_Customer} specifications, (iii) that are modified after delivery by {_Company}, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v) where {_Customer} continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) where {_Customer}'s use of the {_Service} is not strictly in accordance with {_this_Agreement}.  If, due to a claim of infringement, the {_Services} are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by {_Company} to be infringing, {_Company} may, at its option and expense (a) replace or modify the {_Service} to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality, (b) obtain for {_Customer} a license to continue using the {_Service}, or (c) if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate {_this_Agreement} and {_Customer}'s rights hereunder and provide {_Customer} a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the {_Service}.
  
8.Ti=Limitation of Liability

8.sec=<span style="text-transform: uppercase">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except for bodily injury of a person, {_Company} and its suppliers (including but not limited to all equipment and technology suppliers), officers, affiliates, representatives, contractors and employees shall not be responsible or liable with respect to any subject matter of {_this_Agreement} or terms and conditions related thereto under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other theory: (a) for error or interruption of use or for loss or inaccuracy or corruption of data or cost of procurement of substitute goods, services or technology or loss of business; (b) for any indirect, exemplary, incidental, special or consequential damages; (c) for any matter beyond {_Company}'s reasonable control; or (d) for any amounts that, together with amounts associated with all other claims, exceed the fees paid by {_Customer} to {_Company} for the services under {_this_Agreement} in the 12 months prior to the act that gave rise to the liability, in each case, whether or not company has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Note=Liability limitations are frequently heavily negotiated in larger deals. This starting point is very Company-favorable but may need to be scaled back with larger customers

9.=[F/US/00/Agt/Startup/YCombinator/Sales/Sec/Misc_v0.md]

Note=OPTIONAL: there are several variations on these concepts that could be used as a starting point, but start-ups should typically expect resistance from large customers on these points]

EXHIBIT B

SLA.Ti={_Service} Level Terms

Note=OPTIONAL: the language below is an example of a very simple short-form SLA.  These terms can range from one paragraph to several pages depending on the industry, the nature of the solution and the customer profile.

SLA.sec=The {_Services} shall be available 99.9%, measured monthly, excluding holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance.  If {_Customer} requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.  Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond {_Company}'s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. {_Customer}'s sole and exclusive remedy, and {_Company}'s entire liability, in connection with {_Service} availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than {Downtime.Period}, {_Company} will credit {_Customer} 5% of {_Service} fees for each period of 30 or more consecutive minutes of downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per day.  Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as {_Customer} (with notice to {_Company}) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues until the availability of the {_Services} is restored.  In order to receive downtime credit, {_Customer} must notify {_Company} in writing within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit.  Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of {_Service} {_Fees} in any one (1) calendar month in any event.  {_Company} will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred.  {_Company}'s blocking of data communications or other {_Service} in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of {_Company} to provide adequate service levels under {_this_Agreement}.

SLA.=[Z/ol/1]
