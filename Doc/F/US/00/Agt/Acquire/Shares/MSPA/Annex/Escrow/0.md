0.sec={This.sec}<br><br>{That.sec}

This.sec=This {Doc.Ti} (“{_Escrow_Agreement}”) is made as of {EffectiveDate.YMD}, by {Buyer.US.N,E,A} (“{_Buyer}”), those individuals who have executed the signature page to this {_Escrow_Agreement} (collectively “{_Sellers}”), {Seller.Representative.US.N,E,A} as {_Sellers'_Representative}, and {Escrow.Agent.US.N,E,A}, as escrow agent (together with its successors in such capacity, the “{_Escrow_Agent}”).  This is the {_Escrow_Agreement} referred to in the {SPA.Doc.Ti} (the “{_Purchase_Agreement}”), dated {SPA.EffectiveDate.YMD}, between {_Buyer} and {_Sellers}.  Capitalized terms used in this {_Escrow_Agreement} without definition have the respective meanings given to them in the {_Purchase_Agreement}.

That.sec=The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

Deposit.2.sec={_Escrow_Agent} agrees to act as escrow agent and to hold, safeguard, and disburse the {_Escrow_Fund} pursuant to the terms and conditions of this {_Escrow_Agreement}.

If {_Sellers'_Representative} gives notice to {_Buyer} and {_Escrow_Agent} disputing any {_Claim} (a “{_Counter_Notice}”) within 30 days of the effectiveness of the {_Claim_Notice} regarding such {_Claim}, such {_Claim} shall be paid as provided in Paragraph 3(b).  If no {_Counter_Notice} is effective within such 30 day period, the dollar amount of the {_Claim} as set forth in the {_Claim_Notice} shall be deemed established for purposes of this {_Escrow_Agreement} and the {_Purchase_Agreement}, and {_Escrow_Agent} shall promptly pay to {_Buyer} the dollar amount claimed in the {_Claim_Notice} from (and only to the extent of) the {_Escrow_Fund}.  {_Escrow_Agent} shall not inquire into or consider whether a {_Claim} complies with the requirements of the {_Purchase_Agreement}.

Claim.2.sec=If a {_Counter_Notice} is given disputing any {_Claim}, {_Escrow_Agent} shall make payment with respect to such {_Claim} only in accordance with (i) joint written instructions of {_Buyer} and {_Sellers'_Representative}, or (ii) a final nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  {_Escrow_Agent} shall act on such written instructions or court order without further question.

AgentDuty.Ti=Duties of {_Escrow_Agent}

AgentDuty.3.sec={_Escrow_Agent} shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument, or other writing delivered to it pursuant to this {_Escrow_Agreement} without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the service thereof.  {_Escrow_Agent} may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to give the receipt or advice or make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.  {_Escrow_Agent} may conclusively presume that the representative of any party to this {_Escrow_Agreement} has full power and authority to instruct {_Escrow_Agent} on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to {_Escrow_Agent}.

AgentDuty.4.sec={_Escrow_Agent} may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with respect to any matter relating to this {_Escrow_Agreement} and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice.

The parties will provide {_Escrow_Agent} with appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 for tax identification number certification or nonresident alien certifications.

The resignation of {_Escrow_Agent} will take effect on the earlier of (i) the appointment of a successor (including a court of competent jurisdiction), or (ii) the day which is 30 days after the date of delivery of its written notice of resignation to the other parties.  If at that time {_Escrow_Agent} has not received a designation of a successor {_Escrow_Agent}, {_Escrow_Agent}’s sole responsibility after that time shall be to retain and safeguard the {_Escrow_Fund} until receipt of a designation of successor {_Escrow_Agent} or a joint written disposition instruction by the other parties or a final nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

AgentDuty.9.sec=In the event of any disagreement among the other parties resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the {_Escrow_Fund} or in the event that {_Escrow_Agent} is in doubt as to what action it should take under this {_Escrow_Agreement}, {_Escrow_Agent} shall be entitled to retain the {_Escrow_Fund} until {_Escrow_Agent} shall have received (i) joint written instructions of {_Buyer} and {_Sellers'_Representative}, or (ii) a final nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  {_Escrow_Agent} shall act on such written instructions or court order without further question.

Any such compensation and reimbursement to which {_Escrow_Agent} is entitled shall be borne 50% by {_Buyer} and 50% by {_Sellers'_Representative} in its representative capacity.  Any fees or expenses of {_Escrow_Agent} or its counsel that are not paid as provided for in this {_Escrow_Agreement} may be taken from any property held by {_Escrow_Agent} under this {_Escrow_Agreement}.

AgentDuty.11.sec=No printed or other matter in any language (including prospectuses, notices, reports, and promotional material) that mentions {_Escrow_Agent}’s name or the rights, powers, or duties of {_Escrow_Agent} shall be issued by the other parties or on such parties’ behalf unless {_Escrow_Agent} shall first have given its specific written consent thereto.

AgentDuty.12.sec=The other parties authorize {_Escrow_Agent}, for any securities held under this {_Escrow_Agreement}, to use the services of any United States central securities depository it reasonably deems appropriate, including the Depository Trust Company and the Federal Reserve Book Entry System.
(m)	In the event that (i) any dispute shall arise between the parties with respect to the disposition or disbursement of any of the assets held under this {_Escrow_Agreement}, or (ii) {_Escrow_Agent} shall be uncertain as to how to proceed in a situation not explicitly addressed by the terms of this {_Escrow_Agreement}, whether because of conflicting demands by the other parties or otherwise, {_Escrow_Agent} shall be permitted to interplead all of the assets held under this {_Escrow_Agreement} into a court of competent jurisdiction and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets.  The parties other than {_Escrow_Agent} further agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with such a dispute without making {_Escrow_Agent} a party to same.

AgentDuty.13.sec={_Escrow_Agent} shall have only those duties as are specifically provided in this {_Escrow_Agreement}, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and shall under no circumstance be deemed a fiduciary for any of the other parties.  {_Escrow_Agent} shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document between the other parties in connection herewith, including the {_Purchase_Agreement}.  This {_Escrow_Agreement} sets forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated by this {_Escrow_Agreement}, and no additional obligations of {_Escrow_Agent} shall be inferred from the terms of this {_Escrow_Agreement} or any other agreement.  <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In no event shall the {_Escrow_Agent} be liable, directly or indirectly, for (i) damages or expenses arising out of the services provided under this {_Escrow_Agreement}, other than damages which result from the {_Escrow_Agent}’s failure to act in accordance with the standards set forth in this {_Escrow_Agreement}, or (ii) special or consequential damages, even if the {_Escrow_Agent} has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

Limit.=[Z/ol/Base]

Ownership.=[Z/ol/Base]

Transfer.Ti=No Transfer or Encumbrance: Security Interest

Transfer.1.sec=Neither the {_Escrow_Fund} nor any beneficial interest therein may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned, or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law) by {_Sellers}, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of {_Sellers}, prior to the delivery of such {_Escrow_Fund} to {_Sellers'_Representative} by the {_Escrow_Agent} in accordance with this {_Escrow_Agreement}.  The {_Escrow_Agent} shall have no responsibility for determining or enforcing compliance with this Paragraph 8(a), except that the {_Escrow_Agent} shall retain possession of the {_Escrow_Funds} pursuant to Paragraph 1(b).

Transfer.2.sec=The parties acknowledge and agree that {_Sellers}’ interest in the {_Escrow_Fund} is merely a contingent right to payment from the {_Escrow_Fund}, and that neither a voluntary or involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar law nor the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar official in respect of any {_Seller} (any of which, a “Bankruptcy Event”) shall increase such {_Seller}’s interest in the {_Escrow_Fund} or affect, modify, convert, or otherwise change any right such {_Seller} or its estate may have to the {_Escrow_Fund}.  Accordingly, in order to assure the foregoing result even if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (whether or not in connection with a Bankruptcy Event) that a {_Seller} has an interest in the {_Escrow_Fund} that is greater than a contingent right of payment from the {_Escrow_Fund} payable only in accordance with the provisions of this {_Escrow_Agreement}, each {_Seller} hereby grants to {_Buyer}, jointly and severally, effective as of the date of this {_Escrow_Agreement}, a security interest in, and hereby pledges and assigns to {_Buyer}, all of such {_Seller}’s right, title, and interest in the {_Escrow_Fund} (except for such {_Seller}’s contractual rights thereto under this {_Escrow_Agreement}) to secure {_Buyer}’s rights in such {_Seller}’s obligations under this {_Escrow_Agreement}.  {_Escrow_Agent} acknowledges that {_Buyer} has a security interest in the {_Escrow_Fund}, and all funds and instruments comprising the {_Escrow_Fund} from time to time, and {_Escrow_Agent} is maintaining the {_Escrow_Fund} subject to such security interest.  The parties agree that this Paragraph 8(b) shall establish “control,” as defined in Sections 9-104 and 8-106 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the “UCC”), as enacted in {Law.State.the}, and as amended from time to time, of the {_Escrow_Fund}, which control is effective to perfect {_Buyer}’s security interest in the {_Escrow_Fund}.  For purposes of giving effect to such control, the parties agree that if {_Escrow_Agent} shall receive any instruction from {_Buyer} regarding disposition of the {_Escrow_Fund} after {_Buyer} has failed to receive any payment required to be made to it pursuant to Paragraph 3, {_Escrow_Agent} shall comply with such direction without further consent by {_Sellers} or any other person, provided that this provision shall in no way diminish or affect any rights which {_Sellers} may have or be entitled to pursue against {_Buyer} for taking action in violation of other provisions of this {_Escrow_Agreement} or the {_Purchase_Agreement}.  {_Escrow_Agent} and each {_Seller} shall take all actions as may be reasonably requested in writing of it by {_Buyer} to perfect or maintain the security interest created by {_Sellers} in the {_Escrow_Fund}.  {_Buyer} is authorized by the other parties to file UCC financing statements to perfect {_Buyer}’s security interest, with or without execution by the other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Such security interest shall automatically be released with respect to any funds properly distributed from the {_Escrow_Fund} pursuant to the terms of this {_Escrow_Agreement}.  {_Buyer} agrees to execute such instruments of release and termination of the security interest granted under this {_Escrow_Agreement} with respect to any funds properly distributed from the {_Escrow_Fund} received by {_Sellers'_Representative} pursuant to the terms hereof, as may be reasonably requested.
