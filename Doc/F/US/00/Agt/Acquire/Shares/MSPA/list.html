This set of materials reworks the <a href="http://shop.americanbar.org/eBus/Store/ProductDetails.aspx?productId=213974">ABA "Model Stock Purchase Agreement"</a>.  <br>
The "Outline" has (unsurprisingly) the outline of the MSPA - though for convenience of presentation we include only a few of the defined terms.  (The full list of defined terms would overwhelm the presentation.)
The Outline currently also has the full text of the Miscellaneous provisions, to demonstrate how text can be organized.<br>All of the other provisions are available under the "Sec" folder.
