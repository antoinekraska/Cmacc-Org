Ti=Reliance on Certificates and Representations

Note=Heading added by @hazardj.  Also... inconsistency in "the Buyer" vs "Buyer", and has added a (IMHO needless) comma in ", so relied upon."

sec=As to certain matters of fact relevant to the opinions in this opinion letter, we have relied on certificates of officers of {_Buyer} and on factual representations made by the {_Buyer} in the {_Purchase_Agreement}.  We also have relied on certificates of public officials.  We have not independently established the facts or, in the case of certificates of public officials, the other statements, so relied upon.
