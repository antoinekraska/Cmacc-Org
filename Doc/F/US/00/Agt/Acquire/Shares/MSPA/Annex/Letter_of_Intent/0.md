Ladies and Gentlemen:
	This will set forth the preliminary intention of the parties as to general terms upon which __________ ("Buyer") would consider acquiring from you ("Sellers") all the outstanding capital stock of __________ ("Company").
1.	Upon the closing of the sale, Buyer would acquire all of the capital stock of Company from the shareholders of Company in exchange for an aggregate payment at closing of $_________ in cash, subject to adjustment, and promissory notes of Buyer in the aggregate principal amount of $__________.  Each Seller would receive cash equal to $_________ per share owned, subject to adjustment, and a promissory note in the principal amount of $________ per share.  Our willingness to consider this proposed transaction is conditioned on the willingness and eventual agreement of all shareholders of the Company to sell on terms acceptable to Buyer.
2.	As promptly as practicable and in any event by _________, Buyer's counsel will prepare an initial draft of a definitive stock purchase agreement ("Purchase Agreement") and other related agreements for review by you and your counsel.  The draft Purchase Agreement will provide for customary representations and warranties, covenants, conditions to closing, escrows, and indemnities.  The parties will endeavor to negotiate and execute a final definitive Purchase Agreement on or before _________ , and to close the sale on or before _________ .  The parties anticipate that prior to the execution of any definitive Purchase Agreement, Buyer will have the opportunity to conduct due diligence of the Company and you will have the opportunity to conduct due diligence of Buyer.
3.	It is understood that before the parties would consider entering into a definitive Purchase Agreement, (a) Buyer shall have been satisfied with the results of its due diligence investigation of Company, and (b) Buyer shall have become satisfied that it is able to borrow $__ million of the cash portion of the purchase price on terms acceptable to Buyer.
4.	It is agreed that each party shall bear its own legal, accounting, investment banking, and other expenses in connection with the negotiation, documentation, and closing of the acquisition, whether or not a closing occurs.  Any expenses borne by Company would be deducted from the purchase price in the event of a closing.  Each party represents that it has not engaged any broker or finder in connection with the acquisition.
5.	The parties agree that this letter is merely an expression of intent and neither party is under any legal obligation to the other unless and until a definitive Purchase Agreement is executed, except for (a) the provisions of paragraph 4, this paragraph 5, and paragraph 6 and (b) the confidentiality agreement executed by Buyer with respect to the confidential information of Company.
6.	It is agreed that any party may cease pursuit of the contemplated transaction at any time for any or no reason.  No party is obligated to negotiate in good faith.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please execute and return the enclosed copy of this letter.
	Very truly yours,
