Pay.1.sec=Buyer shall pay to Sellers’ Representative on behalf of Sellers an amount equal to (i) the Earnout Amount, multiplied by (ii) the Payment Rate, but only if the Earnout Amount is a positive number (the “Earnout Payment”).

Neither the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

Pay.=[Z/ol-a/s3]

Procedure.Ti=Procedure

Procedure.1.sec=Buyer shall maintain separate accounting books and records for the Acquired Companies during the Earnout Period.  Promptly following the end of the Earnout Period, Buyer shall prepare (i) a consolidated income statement of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Earnout Period, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company (the “Income Statement”), and (ii) a computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, showing separately each of the adjustments made to EBITDA to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA (the “Computation Notice”).  Buyer shall deliver the Income Statement and the Computation Notice to Sellers’ Representative within 45 days following the end of the Earnout Period.

Procedure.2.sec=Upon execution of such access letters as may be reasonably required by Buyer, Sellers’ Representative and its Representatives shall be given reasonable access during reasonable business hours to (and copies of) all Buyer’s and its Representatives’ books, records, and other documents, including work papers, worksheets, notes, and schedules used in preparation of the Income Statement and its computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the Computation Notice for the purpose of reviewing the Income Statement and the Computation Notice, in each case, other than work papers that Buyer considers proprietary, such as internal control documentation, engagement planning, time control and audit sign off, and quality control work papers.

Procedure.3.sec=If, within 45 days following delivery of the Income Statement and the Computation Notice to Sellers’ Representative, Sellers’ Representative has not given Buyer notice of an objection as to any amounts set forth on the Income Statement or the computation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in the Computation Notice (which notice shall state in reasonable detail the basis of Sellers’ Representative’s objection) (the “Objection Notice”), the Adjusted EBITDA as computed by Buyer will be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties.

Procedure.4.sec=If Sellers’ Representative timely gives Buyer an Objection Notice, and if Sellers’ Representative and Buyer fail to resolve the issues raised in the Objection Notice within 30 days after giving the Objection Notice, Sellers’ Representative and Buyer shall submit the issues remaining in dispute for resolution to [name of individual] in the [location] office of [name of accounting firm] (or, if [name of individual or name of accounting firm] is providing accounting services to Buyer or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, a recognized national or regional independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers’ Representative) (the “Independent Accountants”).

Procedure.5.sec=The parties shall negotiate in good faith in order to seek agreement on the procedures to be followed by the Independent Accountants, including procedures with regard to the presentation of evidence.  If the parties are unable to agree upon procedures within 10 days of the submission to the Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall establish such procedures giving due regard to the intention of the parties to resolve disputes as promptly, efficiently, and inexpensively as possible, which procedures may, but need not, be those proposed by either Buyer or Sellers’ Representative.  The Independent Accountants shall be directed to resolve only those issues in dispute and render a written report on their resolution of disputed issues with respect to the Income Statement and the Computation Notice as promptly as practicable but no later than 60 days after the date on which the Independent Accountants are engaged.  The determination of Adjusted EBITDA by the Independent Accountants will be based solely on written submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers’ Representative, on the other hand, and will not involve independent review.  Any determination by the Independent Accountants will not be outside the range established by the amounts in (i) the Income Statement and the computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the Computation Notice proposed by Buyer, and (ii) Sellers’ Representative’s proposed adjustments thereto.  Such determination will be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties.

Procedure.6.0.sec=If the computation of Adjusted EBITDA is submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution:

Procedure.6.1.sec=Sellers’ Representative and Buyer shall execute any agreement required by the Independent Accountants to accept their engagement pursuant to this Paragraph 3;

Procedure.6.2.sec=Sellers’ Representative and Buyer shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants may request and are available to that party or its accountants or other Representatives, and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountants, with a copy to the other party, any other written material relating to the disputed issues;

Procedure.6.3.sec=the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a report to be delivered by the Independent Accountants to both Sellers’ Representative and Buyer, will include all the changes in the Income Statement and the computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the Computation Notice required as a result of the determination made by the Independent Accountants; and

Procedure.6.4.sec=Sellers and Buyer shall each bear one-half of the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants; provided, however, that the engagement agreement referred to in clause (i) above may require the parties to be bound jointly and severally to the Independent Accountants for those fees and costs, and in the event Sellers or Buyer pay to the Independent Accountants any amount in excess of one-half of the fees and costs of their engagement, the other party(ies) agree(s) to reimburse Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, upon demand to the extent required to equalize the payments made by Sellers and Buyer with respect to the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants.
