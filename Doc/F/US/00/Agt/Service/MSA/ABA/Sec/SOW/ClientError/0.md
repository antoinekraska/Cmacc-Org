1.Ti={_Vendor}’s Failure to Perform

1.0.sec={_Vendor}’s failure to perform its responsibilities under this Agreement and/or an {_SOW} shall be excused if and only to the extent such {_Vendor} non-performance is directly caused by {_Client}’s wrongful action or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement and/or the applicable {_SOW}, but only if:

1.1.sec=(a) {_Vendor} notifies {_Client} in writing and expeditiously (under the circumstances) of such wrongful action or failure to perform and {_Vendor}’s consequent inability to perform under such circumstances;

1.2.sec=(b) {_Vendor} provides {_Client} with every reasonable opportunity to correct such wrongful action or failure to perform and thereby avoid such {_Vendor} non-performance; and
