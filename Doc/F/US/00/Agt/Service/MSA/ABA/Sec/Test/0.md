Ti=Testing Process

1.Ti=Test Plan

1.sec={_Vendor} shall be responsible for testing the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, as applicable, in accordance with a test plan to be mutually developed and agreed to by the Parties in writing (“Test Plan”), which Test Plan will incorporate testing methodologies to confirm that the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, as applicable, operate in accordance with the applicable Documentation, Specifications, Service Levels, Interoperability Requirements, and Performance Standards. The Test Plan will be developed in accordance with the time frame specified in the applicable SOW, and the date to complete development of the Test Plan shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, be a Critical Path Milestone. In addition to the above, each Test Plan shall describe the exact scope, methodologies, and procedures (including expected performance results) for testing the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof. When approved by {_Client} in writing, the Test Plan will be attached to the applicable {_SOW}. {_Client} may modify or amend the scope, methodologies, and procedures for executing the testing process to include additional testing criteria as may be reasonably necessary to conduct the testing in accordance with the Project Change Order process set forth in Section 2.2 ({_Project_Change_Procedures}).

2.Ti=Pre-Live Testing

2.sec=Pre-live testing for the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, as applicable (“Pre-Live Testing”) shall commence on the date specified in the applicable SOW, including the execution of the test suites as provided for in the applicable Test Plan. If any Defects in the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, are discovered as a result of Pre-Live Testing, {_Vendor} shall promptly correct such Defects. When all Defects identified during Pre-Live Testing have been corrected, {_Client} shall give {_Vendor} written notice thereof and the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, shall thereafter be ready for Live Testing.

3.Ti=Live Testing

3.sec=Following successful completion of all Pre-Live Testing, {_Client} shall have the period specified for Live Testing in the applicable {_SOW} (“Live Testing Period”) to test the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, under actual, everyday operating conditions to assess whether such Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, operate in accordance with the applicable Documentation, Specifications, Service Levels, and Performance Standards (“Live Testing”). In the event any Defects in the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, are discovered during the Live Testing Period, {_Client} shall report such Defects to {_Vendor}, and {_Vendor} shall promptly correct all Defects in the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof. Upon {_Vendor}’s receipt of notice from {_Client} of any Defects, the Live Testing Period (but not {_Client}’s use of the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof) shall be suspended temporarily and shall recommence upon {_Vendor}’s receipt of written notice from {_Client} that such Defects have been corrected; provided, however, that {_Client} shall in no event have less than fifteen (15) days to verify any correction provided by {_Vendor}. Subject to the terms of Section 5.5 (Failure to Achieve Acceptance), such process shall repeat as often as necessary until all Defects have been corrected. Successful Live Testing shall occur when the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof: (a) has been operating for the Live Testing Period and all Material Defects have been corrected; and (b) has been operating during the last ten (10) days of the Live Testing Period without experiencing any Material Defects.

4.Ti=Acceptance

4.sec=“Acceptance” for the applicable Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, shall occur only when: (a) {_Vendor} has corrected, to {_Client}’s satisfaction, all Material Defects identified by the Parties during testing; (b) {_Vendor} has provided to {_Client} all Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, required to be provided to {_Client} pursuant to the applicable {_SOW}, and each of the Parties has completed all tasks required to be completed by such Party that are identified by the Parties as a pre-condition to {_Client}’s acceptance; and (c) either (i) {_Client} notifies {_Vendor} in writing that all testing for the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, as applicable, has been completed successfully in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.4 (Acceptance) and the applicable {_SOW} and that the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above have been satisfied to {_Client}’s satisfaction, or (ii) {_Vendor} provides to the {_Client_Project_Manager} a written notice of completion stating that {_Vendor} believes all testing for the Services and/or Deliverables, or components thereof, has been completed successfully in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.4 (Acceptance) and the applicable {_SOW} and that the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above have been satisfied, unless {_Client} provides {_Vendor} with notice to the contrary within fifteen (15) days following the date of receipt by the {_Client_Project_Manager} of {_Vendor}’s written notice of completion, in which case Acceptance shall not occur and the Parties shall continue the applicable testing in accordance with this Article 5 (Testing Process). With respect to {_SOWs} involving more than one phase or rollout, the testing and acceptance process may be conducted on a per-phase/rollout basis, with final Acceptance occurring only upon successful completion and acceptance of each phase/rollout, as mutually agreed by the Parties and set forth in the applicable {_SOW}. Nothing else, including {_Client}’s use of the Services and/or Deliverables, or any components thereof, in a live, operational environment, shall constitute Acceptance (under applicable state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), as adopted by any state) of any portion of the Services and/or Deliverables, and/or the applicable {_SOW}.

5.Ti=Failure to Achieve Acceptance

5.sec=In the event Acceptance is not achieved within ninety (90) days following commencement of Live Testing, {_Client} shall have the right to declare an Event of Default and seek the rights and remedies available to it under Article 8 (Term and Termination). Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, upon the occurrence of such event with respect to the {_SOW}, {_Client} shall be entitled to a full refund of any and all fees, expenses and amounts paid to {_Vendor} in connection with or related to the applicable SOW.

6.Ti=Post-Acceptance Correction of Defects

6.sec={_Vendor} shall correct any Defects in the Services and/or Deliverables, or any components thereof, remaining to be corrected following Acceptance under the applicable {_SOW}.
