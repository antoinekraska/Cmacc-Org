Ti=Audits

1.Ti=Compliance Audits

1.sec=Upon notice from {_Client}, {_Vendor} shall provide {_Client}, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), inspectors, regulators, and other reasonably designated representatives as {_Client} may from time to time designate in writing (collectively, the “{_Client} Auditors”) with access to, at reasonable times, to any facility or part of a facility at which either {_Vendor} or any of its subcontractors is providing the Services, to {_Vendor} Personnel, and to data and records relating to the Services for purposes of verifying compliance with this Agreement (including {_Vendor}’s compliance with its physical and data privacy and security obligations and other terms of this Agreement) and to support {_Client}’s audits of the business of {_Client} relating to the Services. {_Vendor} will provide any assistance that {_Client} Auditors may reasonably require with respect to such audits. All financial and non-financial transactions resulting from this Agreement shall be documented by {_Vendor} and subject to audit by the {_Client} Auditors. {_Vendor} and {_Client} shall meet to review each audit report promptly and to agree upon an appropriate and effective manner in which to respond to the deficiencies identified and changes recommended by such audit report.

2.Ti={_Client}-Initiated Control and Procedure Audits

2.sec={_Vendor} agrees to provide any assistance reasonably requested by {_Client} relating to disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or otherwise), including but not limited to: (a) {_Client}’s review of any documented {_Vendor}’s controls and procedures related to the Services; (b) cooperating with the {_Client} Auditors in connection with the testing of such controls and procedures; (c) informing {_Client} on a timely basis regarding any material changes to such controls and procedures; (d) remediating any material weakness or significant deficiency in complying with {_Vendor}’s controls and procedures related to the Services, at {_Vendor}’s expense, and (e) permitting {_Client} to perform an audit of the Services (including the internal control environment relating to thereto). It is hereby understood that, except as otherwise stated above, any fees or costs incurred by {_Client} Auditors, or any incremental costs incurred by {_Vendor} in complying with {_Client}’s audit requirements in connection with this Section (to the extent that such requirements cause {_Vendor} to provide services that it does not routinely provide to its clients), shall be the responsibility of {_Client}.

3.Ti={_Vendor}-Initiated Control Audits

3.sec=Throughout the Term of this Agreement, {_Vendor} shall provide {_Client}, at {_Client}’s written request, copies of reports resulting from audits performed by independent, qualified external auditors engaged by {_Vendor} that assess the internal controls and information security related to the Services (“{_Vendor} Audits”). The reports from such {_Vendor} Audits (“{_Vendor} Audit Reports”) will comply with current industry standards, including generally accepted auditing standards such as, without limitation, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement on Auditing Standards Number 70 (SAS 70). More specifically such {_Vendor} Audit Report will comply with the requirements of a “Type II” report as defined by SAS 70.

4.Ti=Fee Audits

4.sec=Upon notice from {_Client}, {_Vendor} shall provide {_Client} Auditors with access to such financial books and records and supporting documentation (excluding {_Vendor}’s cost data and internal cost analysis) as may be requested by the {_Client} Auditors. {_Client} Auditors may audit {_Vendor}’s charges to {_Client} to determine if such charges are accurate and in accordance with this Agreement. If, as a result of such audit, {_Client} determines that {_Vendor} has overcharged {_Client}, {_Client} shall notify {_Vendor} of the amount of such overcharge and {_Vendor} shall (in addition to any and all other remedies that may be available to {_Client}) promptly pay to {_Client} the amount of the overcharge, plus interest, calculated from the date of receipt by {_Vendor} of the overcharged amount until the date of payment to {_Client}. If {_Client} determines that {_Vendor} has undercharged {_Client}, {_Client} shall notify {_Vendor} of such undercharge. In addition to {_Client}’s rights set forth in this Section 9.5.4 (Fee Audits), in the event any such audit reveals an overcharge to {_Client} of three percent (3%) or more for any {_SOW}, {_Vendor} shall (in addition to any and all other remedies that may be available to {_Client}) reimburse {_Client} for the cost of such audit associated with the particular {_SOW}.
