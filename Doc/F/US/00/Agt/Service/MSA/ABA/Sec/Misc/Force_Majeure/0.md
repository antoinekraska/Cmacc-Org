Ti=Force Majeure

1.Ti=Definition

1.sec=Subject to {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Use of Alternate Vendors by {_Client}) below, neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any {_SOW}, if any, to the extent such failure or delay both: (a) is caused, without fault of the non-performing Party, by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature, or acts of God; acts of war, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions; quarantines, embargoes, and other similar governmental action; or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party; and (b) could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and cannot reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, work-around plans or other means.

2.Ti=Excused Performance

2.sec=Events meeting both of the criteria set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of  {ForceMajeure.Xref}.1 (Definition) above are referred to collectively as “Force Majeure Events”. Subject to {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Use of Alternate Vendors by {_Client}) below, upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing Party shall be excused from its non-performance or observance of the affected obligation(s) for as long as such circumstances prevail and such Party continues to attempt to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance will immediately notify the other by telephone or by the most timely means otherwise available (to be confirmed in writing within two (2) business days of the inception of such delay) and describe in reasonable detail the circumstances causing such delay.

3.Ti=Use of Alternate Vendors by {_Client}

3.sec=If a Force Majeure Event causes a material failure or delay in the performance of any Services for more than five (5) consecutive days, {_Client} shall have the right, at its sole election, and in addition to any rights {_Client} may have pursuant to {Life.TerminateForceMajeure.Xref-8.3} (Termination for Force Majeure), procure such Services from an alternate source until {_Vendor} is again able to provide such Services. {_Client} shall continue to pay {_Vendor} the applicable fees for Services actually rendered by {_Vendor}, less any amounts payable by {_Client} to the alternate source, but {_Vendor} shall not be entitled to any additional payments as a result of the Force Majeure Event. Notwithstanding any other provision of this {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Force Majeure), a Force Majeure Event shall not relieve {_Vendor} of its obligation to implement successfully all of the Services relating to disaster recovery and business continuity services that are included in any {_SOW} within the time period described in such {_SOW}.

4.Ti=Allocation of Resources

4.sec=Without limiting {_Vendor}’s obligations under this Agreement, whenever a Force Majeure Event causes {_Vendor} to allocate limited resources between or among {_Vendor}’s customers, {_Client} shall receive at least the same treatment as comparable {_Vendor} customer. In no event will {_Vendor} redeploy or reassign any {_Vendor} Personnel to another customer or account in the event of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event without the prior written consent of {_Client}, which consent may be withheld in {_Client}’s sole discretion.
