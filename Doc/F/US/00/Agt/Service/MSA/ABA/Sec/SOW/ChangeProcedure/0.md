Ti={_Project_Change_Procedures}

1.Ti={_Project_Change_Request}

1.sec=If either Party believes that a change (whether in the processes, procedures, standards, Service Levels, time frames, costs or deliverables) is necessary or desirable, such Party shall submit a written change request to the other Party (a “{_Project_Change_Request}”). {_Vendor} represents to {_Client} that it has factored into {_Vendor}’s fee adequate contingencies for de minimis change orders. Accordingly, if {_Project_Change_Request}s are made, they will be presumed not to impact the fees under this Agreement; provided, however, that if the {_Project_Change_Request} consists of other than a de minimis deviation from the scope of the SOW, {_Vendor} shall provide {_Client} with written notification of such other deviation within {SOW.ChangeOrder.VendorNoticeOfNonDeMinimis.Within.cl} after receipt of the {_Project_Change_Request}.

2.Ti={_Project_Change_Response}

2.sec=In the event of a {_Client}-initiated {_Project_Change_Request}, within {SOW.ChangeOrder.VendorNoticeOfImpact.Within.cl} of {_Vendor}’s receipt of such {_Project_Change_Request}, {_Vendor} shall provide to {_Client} a written statement describing in detail: (a) the impact on any {_Client} System performance, if any, and the modifications to the {_Client} System that will be required as a result of the {_Project_Change_Request} including changes in Services and/or Deliverables; (b) the effect of the {_Project_Change_Request} on the applicable SOW plans and tasks including any impact on any Critical Path Milestone dates; and (c) an estimate of the cost to implement each {_Project_Change_Request} (collectively, the “{_Project_Change_Response}”). If {_Vendor} submits a {_Project_Change_Request} to {_Client}, such {_Project_Change_Request} shall include the information required for a {_Project_Change_Response}. {_Client} shall accept or reject any {_Project_Change_Response} or {_Vendor}-initiated {_Project_Change_Request}, as applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt of same from {_Vendor}.

3.Ti=Project Change Order

3.sec=If {_Client} accepts a {_Project_Change_Response} or {_Vendor}-initiated {_Project_Change_Request} in writing, such {_Project_Change_Response}, together with {_Client}’s {_Project_Change_Request}, or such {_Vendor}-initiated {_Project_Change_Request}, shall be deemed to be a “Project Change Order” and shall become part of this Agreement and the applicable {_SOW}. If {_Client} rejects {_Vendor}’s {_Project_Change_Response} or {_Vendor}-initiated {_Project_Change_Request}, {_Vendor} shall proceed to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the applicable {_SOW}. Without first obtaining {_Client}’s prior written approval in accordance with the Project Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 ({_Project_Change_Procedures}), which approval {_Client} may withhold in its sole discretion, {_Vendor} shall make no Project Change which may: (a) increase {_Client}’s total cost of the Services and/or Deliverables; (b) require changes to {_Client}’s Systems, facilities, software, utilities, tools or equipment; (c) require {_Client} to install a new version, release, upgrade of, or replacement for, any software or equipment or to modify any software or equipment; (d) have an adverse impact on the functionality, interoperability, performance, security, accuracy, speed, responsiveness, quality, or resource efficiency of the Services and/or Deliverables; (e) have an adverse impact on the schedule for and the delivery of services and/or products by {_Client} to its clients and customers; or (f) violate or be inconsistent with the {_Client} Policies and/or applicable Laws.
