Ti=General Criteria for the Performance of Services

sec={_Vendor} shall perform the Services in a manner that shall: (a) avoid any adverse impact on the business, operations, financial condition and/or prospects of {_Client}; and (b) not degrade the services then being received by {_Client} from other Third Parties or provided internally by {_Client}. Prior to undertaking any Services-related activity or task, {_Vendor} shall discuss with {_Client} all known material risks and shall not proceed with such activity or task until {_Client} is satisfied with the plans with regard to such risks (provided, however, that, neither {_Vendor}’s disclosure of any such risks to {_Client}, nor {_Client} acquiescence in {_Vendor}’s plans, shall operate or be construed as limiting {_Vendor}’s responsibilities under this Agreement). {_Vendor} shall identify and resolve any problems that may impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the SOW that is {_Vendor}’s responsibility and shall use its best efforts to assist {_Client} with the resolution of any problems that may impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the SOW that is {_Client}’s responsibility.
