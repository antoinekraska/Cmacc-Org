2.Ti=Licensed {_Vendor} Materials

2.sec=“Licensed {_Vendor} Materials” shall mean {_Vendor} Materials that are incorporated in any Deliverables. {_Vendor} hereby grants to {_Client} a nonexclusive, irrevocable, world-wide, perpetual, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, maintain, support, and create derivative works of the Licensed {_Vendor} Materials solely as a part of the Deliverables, for the benefit of {_Client} and its Affiliates. {_Client} may not extract Licensed {_Vendor} Materials from the Deliverables for use separately therefrom, unless so permitted by {_Vendor}. The foregoing license shall include use by {_Client}’s employees, Third Party service providers, consultants, auditors, agents, and representatives, to the extent providing services to or on behalf of {_Client}. Any additional license terms and conditions shall be as mutually agreed in an {_SOW}. The Parties acknowledge that Licensed {_Vendor} Materials created under an {_SOW} may be considered by {_Client} to have competitive value to {_Client} (e.g., they are based on {_Client}’s Confidential Information and/or specific know how). Accordingly, with respect to Licensed {_Vendor} Materials that are identified as “Competitive Materials” in an {_SOW}, the license granted under this Section 9.1.2 (Licensed {_Vendor} Materials) shall be deemed to be exclusive to {_Client}.
