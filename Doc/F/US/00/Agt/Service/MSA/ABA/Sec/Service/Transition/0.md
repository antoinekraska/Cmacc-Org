1.Ti=Transition Generally

1.sec=During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on or before {Transition.Deadline.YMD}, {_Vendor} shall plan, prepare for and conduct the transition of certain operations all in accordance with the Transition Plan (the “Transition”). {_Vendor}’s responsibilities with respect to the Transition include: (a) performing the tasks set forth in the Transition Plan in accordance with the Transition Milestones; (b) performing the Services without interruption and without disrupting {_Client}’s business operations; (c) paying all costs associated with the Transition, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the {_SOW}; and (d) performing such other transition and migration tasks as are necessary to enable {_Vendor} to complete the Transition and provide the Services.

2.Ti=Transition Plan

2.sec=The Transition shall be conducted in accordance with a written plan which shall include: (a) a description of the operations being transitioned; (b) a description of the methods and procedures, personnel and organization that {_Vendor} will use to perform the Transition; (c) a schedule of transition activities; (d) a detailed description of the respective roles and responsibilities of {_Client} and {_Vendor}; and (e) such other information and planning as are necessary to ensure that the Transition takes place on schedule and without disruption to {_Client} operations (the “Transition Plan”). The draft of the Transition Plan as of the Effective Date is attached to the Agreement as Schedule 3.4.2 (Transition Plan). {_Vendor} shall be responsible for revising and finalizing the Transition Plan; provided that: (A) {_Vendor} shall cooperate and work closely with {_Client} in finalizing the Transition Plan (including incorporating {_Client}’s reasonable comments); and (B) the final Transition Plan (and any changes thereto) shall be subject to written approval by {_Client}.

3.Ti=Completion of Transition

3.sec={_Client} reserves the right to monitor, observe, and participate in the Transition and, to the extent applicable, test any technical elements of the Transition. {_Vendor} will notify {_Client} without delay if such monitoring, participation or testing has caused (or if {_Vendor} expects it to cause) a problem or delay in the Transition, and will work with {_Client} to prevent or circumvent the problem or delay. If any Transition Milestone is not completed on or before the given date for such Transition Milestone due primarily to the fault of {_Vendor}, then for the period of delay: (a) {_Vendor} shall pay to {_Client} the applicable out of pocket costs {_Client} incurs as a result of the delay until such Transition Milestone is completed; (b) if {_Vendor}’s charges to {_Client} are greater than they would have been if the delayed Transition Milestone had been completed on schedule, {_Client} will receive a credit against {_Vendor}’s monthly charges in an amount equal to the difference between {_Vendor}’s actual charges and what {_Vendor}’s charges would have been if the delayed Transition Milestone had been completed on schedule; and (c) {_Vendor} shall pay to {_Client} actual costs incurred by {_Client} as a result of such delay, including costs incurred in having to extend Third Party contracts.
