# CmaccDeal-Acme-Ang-YC-Note
A demo set of documents for a YC SAFE Note.

This repo shows a "deal" in four variations.  A single term sheet provides the parameters for four variations on the YC-SAFE investment note.

In an ideal world (one in which principals and their lawyers use git), they could collaborate/negotiate the terms of the transaction via pull requests.  One of the lawyers would likely manage the requests for the community.  Each lawyer would manage pull requests from their own clients.

To avoid issues about variations to the underlying repo (Cmacc-Source), the final should note the current commit hashes (e.g., a76d199) of the underlying repos.
