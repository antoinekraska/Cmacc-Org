Note=Mix and match.  In this example, the CooleyGo version of a Waiver section is replaced by a "standard" form of waiver provision based on the American Bar Association's Model Stock Purchase Agreement waiver section.  We override the Misc.Waive.Sec with the standard version and replace the defined terms with ones appropriate for the NDA.  We also eliminate the Oxford comma (q).
