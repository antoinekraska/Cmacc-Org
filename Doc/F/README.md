CmaccDoc_JurisdictionTree_F

A list of jurisdictions, with form agreements and other materials organized by subject matter.  One blank jurisdiction, "/00/", has common structures.  This facilitates common organization, equivalence and convergence.

We expect that each jurisdiction will be handled separately, by a local "Center for Decentralized Governance."
